When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1- To avoid risk of losing my work
    2- To work and collaborate with others in a good manner
    3- To access my work from anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    yet.
