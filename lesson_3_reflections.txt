When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1- To avoid risk of losing my work
    2- To work and collaborate with others in a good manner
    3- To access my work from anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because i dont want that everytime i modify any code, it is there on the
    remote. May be I am experimenting or i dont want to share it with others
    yet. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches: are in same repositories, refer to different paths of commits and
    commits from one branch can not be reached from the others generally(until 
    they have been merged).
    Clones: copying a whole repository either from remote to local or local to
    local.
    Forks: copying a whole repository from remote into our own account on GitHub.
    It also has side-effects like GitHub keeps track of the number of forks and link
    to the parent repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can work offline and later by command git fetch, we can have both remote and our local
    work separately in our local machine. Later we can merge and push the changes. While doing
    git pull, we have to first resolve conflicts always.
