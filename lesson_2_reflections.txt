What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It contains a .git directory inside it. We need to do it because after this only 
	all the information about commits(meta-data) will be stored and then only other 
	git commands like status and log will work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area: a subset of working directory which we really want to commit.
	It offers us flexibility to add multiple files together to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	Add one file at a time to the staging area.
